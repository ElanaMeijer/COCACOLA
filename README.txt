Thank you for downloading this MATLAB software for COCACOLA. This package contains the following files.

	blocknnls.m -> non-negative least square wrapper
	calCorrMat.m -> calculate the pairwise correlation of feature-object matrix
	calInternalIdx.m -> calculate TSS minimization index
	clustAgg_Lmethod.m -> eliminate suspicious clusters using bottom-up L Method
	clustAgg_SepCond.m -> merge closely mixed clusters by separable conductance
	example.m -> a demo on simulated 'strain' dataset
	myKmeansPar.m -> implementation of k-means clustering
	myNMF.m -> key algorithm
	data -> example datasets
	nmf_bpas -> non-negative least square algorithm developed by Kim and Park [1,2]
	vlfeat-0.9.20 -> open source library implements very fast version of k-means [3]

Please try to execute 'example.m' to learn how to use this software given the input generated by CONCOCT. And please check the description of 'myNMF.m' for the detailed usage of the algorithm.

Please send bug reports, comments, or questions to Yang Lu (ylu465@usc.edu).
